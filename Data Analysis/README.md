## ðŸ”§ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Imported the raw dataset from Kaggle
   - Removed missing/duplicate records.  
   - Outlier detection using Modified Z-score. (Retaining the core within the 1%-99% range to minimize noise values while preserving data integrity)
   - Feature engineering: `price_per_sqft_living`, `price_bin`.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution and correlation analysis 
   - Categorical comparisons (renovation impact, city-level price variation).  
   - Geographic segmentation by city and ZIP code.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Split the data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 ratio) and trained models to predict price based on selected features
   - Prediction models (Decision Tree, Lasso & Linear Regression).  
   - Evaluation metrics: **RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE**.  
   - Cross-validation to ensure stability and avoid overfitting.

## Executive Summary  
- **Data Cleaning**: Reduced noise by removing some redundant or highly correlated variables.  
- **Exploratory Insights**: Price strongly correlates with `sqft_living` and `city`, but surprisingly `condition` and `view` have minimal effect on price
- **Modeling**: Regression models were applied to predict house prices.

- A predictive model was built to estimate house prices based on features such as square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, condition, location, and renovation status.
- The cleaned dataset allowed for more meaningful insights and better model accuracy.
- Model evaluation primarily used RÂ² (coefficient of determination). From the notebook, different models achieved RÂ² values ranging from ~0.70 to ~0.80, suggesting the model explains a large portion of price variability.

This project successfully builds a house price prediction model using the house sales in USA dataset, demonstrating end-to-end data science skills. Key steps included data loading from Kaggle, cleaning (handling zeros/missing values, remove outliers, feature engineering), EDA (visualizations with Matplotlib/Seaborn), and Modeling.


This analysis successfully developed a high-performance predictive model for King County housing prices, achieving 76% explanatory power (RÂ² = 0.76) on test data. The model demonstrates strong practical utility with a mean absolute error of $105,000, representing reliable accuracy for mid-range residential properties.

## Insight Deepdive  
- **Living Space Matters**: `sqft_living` is the single most powerful predictor of house price, explaining a large share of price variation.
- **City Effect**: Prices vary substantially across cities, with premium urban locations outperforming suburban areas.  \
- **Price Segmentation**: Using `price_bin` shows clustering of mid-market properties, with only a small fraction in the high-end luxury category.
- Living area (sqft_living) had the strongest correlation with price â€” larger homes command significantly higher prices.
- Number of bathrooms and more urban city can also be factor increased property values.
- Renovations positively impacted prices, with recently renovated houses showing a notable premium.
- House age had a negative relationship with price, though recently built or renovated houses countered this effect.
- Location mattered: Certain ZIP codes and cities consistently showed higher market values (e.g., Bellevue, Redmond).

## Visualization
### Distribution of Housing Prices per Sqft (Living Area after cleaning)
House prices were right-skewed, with most properties concentrated under $1M ($400 per living sqft), but a few luxury homes significantly increased variance.
<img width="1315" height="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb24d394-901d-4563-837b-749cf938a6f4" />

### Correlation Analysis
<img width="1398" height="1270" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3c18e0d-822a-4491-b961-5f645cb7fb4a" />
Key variables strongly correlated with price with high signifcant:
- Living area size (Square footage of living space was the most important determinant of price)
- Number of Bathrooms and Bedrooms
- View
Weaker correlation with high significant
- Waterfront
- Condition of the house

### Categorical Insights (Renovation Premium)

<img width="1390" height="745" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac073199-9847-4feb-bd7c-e2ef9c438165" />

The effect of renovation on negative for most, especially more urban city, where there is significant p-value (they tend to have most negative renovation premium too)
Renovation premiums vary widely by city

Some cities (e.g., Normandy Park, Maple Valley, Mercer Island) show positive renovation premiums of +10â€“13%. Renovations are rewarded by the market there.

Other cities (e.g., SeaTac, Tukwila, Kirkland) show negative premiums of â€“20% to â€“28%. Renovated houses are actually valued lower than comparable non-renovated ones.

Significance matters

Significant (blue dots): In cities like Seattle, Kenmore, Covington, Bellevue, Renton, Kirkland, Tukwila, SeaTac, the renovation premiums (mostly negative) are statistically significant. That means the discount effect is real and consistent.

Not significant (gray dots): In some cities, premiums (positive or negative) are not statistically different from zero â€” suggesting renovations donâ€™t have a clear measurable impact there.

Geographic divergence

Newer and Wealthier markets (e.g., Mercer Island) show positive returns on renovations. Buyers are willing to pay extra for updated homes in premium neighborhoods.

In contrast, lower-value or more saturated markets (e.g., SeaTac, Tukwila) penalize renovated homes â€” possibly because buyers prioritize affordability over upgrades, or renovations canâ€™t offset other negative location factors.


**Impact of House Age on Renovation Premium**

<img width="1189" height="832" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cec5f83-221d-4c83-a4ab-ba44117f961f" />

Negative Relationship:
The regression line slopes downward â€” meaning as the age difference increases (renovated homes are much older compared to non-renovated homes), the renovation premium decreases.
Premium Exists for Newer Renovations:
When renovated homes are not significantly older (or even newer) compared to non-renovated homes, the renovation premium is closer to 0% or slightly positive. This suggests buyers are willing to pay extra for relatively recent renovations.
Penalty for Older Renovated Homes:
When renovated homes are much older, buyers tend to discount them â€” in some cases, the premium turns negative (renovated homes are valued less than non-renovated ones). This may reflect structural aging or that renovations canâ€™t fully compensate for being an older property.
High Variability Across Cities:
The wide spread of points (and the broad confidence interval) indicates city-level differences in how renovations are valued. Renovation premium is not consistent everywhere.


**Average house price by city**
<img width="1589" height="1234" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/986c2bb0-6dc4-47ba-b56f-f99d14147493" />
Top 3 most expensive cities:

Medina, Clyde Hill, Mercer Island â†’ Luxury markets with extremely high housing costs, driven by location desirability, amenities, and possibly proximity to high-income employers (e.g., tech hubs).

Top 3 cheapest cities:

Algona, Pacific, Skykomish â†’ Affordable housing markets, possibly due to distance from economic centers, smaller populations, or less demand.

Middle-tier clustering

Many cities fall in the $500Kâ€“$700K range, suggesting a fairly balanced mid-market.

Cities like Bellevue, Sammamish, etc are above this mid-tier, aligning with their status as highly desirable residential areas.

### Predicted vs. Actual Price distribution plot shows most predictions cluster closely around the diagonal line, indicating good performance.
<img width="1189" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc25ff51-95a3-4e0e-96ab-4cf9fc169e37" />

- The modelâ€™s predicted price of ~$495K is well-supported by the actual market distribution, reinforcing that the model captures key value drivers for comparable properties.
- The predicted price (~$495K) falls near the center of the actual price distribution, meaning the modelâ€™s estimate is consistent with observed comparable home sales.
- This increases confidence in the modelâ€™s accuracy for this property type.


Feature importance analysis highlights sqft_living, bathrooms, view, and waterfront as top predictors.

## Recommendations  
- **For Buyers**:  
  - Focus on living space and properties with recent renovation with good renovation quality, as these add measurable value.  
  - For long-term appreciation, properties in cities with sustained demand are strong investments.
  - Affordability varies dramatically; location choice has the single largest impact on housing cost. Buyers priced out of premium areas may find mid-market alternatives within commuting distance.
 
    
- For Homeowners:
  - Renovating older homes may not guarantee a positive price premium. Renovations are more valuable when done on relatively newer or middle-aged homes.
  - Renovation adds value in select markets (e.g., Mercer Island, Normandy Park), but in other cities (e.g., SeaTac, Tukwila), it may not pay off financially.

- **For Sellers**:  
  - Renovations prior to listing can yield significant ROI, especially for recently renovate homes.
  - Renovations may yield the best returns in areas where housing stock is not significantly aged compared to the market average.

- **For Future Work**:  
  - Incorporate external data (school quality, crime rates, economic indicators) for improved predictive performance.  
  - Apply advanced models (e.g., gradient boosting, XGBoost) to reduce error on luxury homes.
  - Incorporate external economic indicators (interest rates, employment, regional development).
  - Experiment with non-linear models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forests) for better performance.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to avoid overfitting and improve generalization.
