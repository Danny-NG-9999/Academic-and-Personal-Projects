**Cleaned Dataset**
Following rigorous cleaning, outlier removal using the Modified Z-score method (retaining data within the 1%-99% range to focus on the most representative samples), and feature engineering, the dataset was refined to 4,401 rows. This process introduced three additional columns for enhanced analysis:

| **Column**              | **Description**                                                                 | **Data Type** |

| `price_bin`             | Price segmentation bin for grouping properties into ranges (e.g., low, mid, high) | float64       |

**Final Data Structure**
The cleaned final dataset was expanded to 43 columns after transforming categorical variables (e.g., city) into dummy variables for modeling. Redundant features such as street and sqft_lot were dropped to streamline modeling prediction.

   - Imported the raw dataset from Kaggle
   - Removed missing/duplicate records.  
   - Outlier detection using Modified Z-score. (Retaining the core within the 1%-99% range to minimize noise values while preserving data integrity)
   - Feature engineering: `price_per_sqft_living`, `price_bin`.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution and correlation analysis 
   - Categorical comparisons (renovation impact, city-level price variation).  
   - Geographic segmentation by city and ZIP code.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Split the data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 ratio) and trained models to predict price based on selected features

## üîç Insights Deepdive
This analysis highlights the **primary drivers of housing prices** in King County and reveals how property characteristics, renovations, and geography interact to shape market values.  

<details>
<summary>üìå Core Value Drivers</summary>

- **Living Space Dominance**: `sqft_living` is the strongest predictor (~0.70 correlation), confirming that larger homes consistently command higher prices.  
- **Bathroom Premium**: Each additional bathroom adds more value than an extra bedroom, reflecting higher marginal utility.  
- **View Quality**: Properties with desirable views capture notable premiums, though they represent fewer than 10% of listings..  
- **Condition & Waterfront**:  Both exert weaker-than-expected influence, suggesting subjectivity in ratings or undervaluation of these features. 

</details>

<details>
<summary>üåç Geographic Segmentation</summary>

- **Premium Markets**: Cities like **Medina, Clyde Hill, Mercer Island** command 2‚Äì3√ó county averages, driven by location desirability and affluence.  
- **Mid-Tier Clusters**: The majority of cities fall in the **$400K‚Äì$700K range**, representing stable mid-market housing.  
- **Affordable Segments**: Cities like **Algona, Pacific, Skykomish** provide entry-level affordability but with limited growth potential.  

</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ† Renovation ROI</summary>

- **Positive ROI**: Affluent areas such as **Mercer Island, Normandy Park, Maple Valley** yield **+10‚Äì13% price premiums** for renovated homes.  
- **Negative ROI**: More saturated or affordability-driven markets like **SeaTac, Tukwila, Kirkland** show **‚Äì20% to ‚Äì28% discounts** for renovated homes.  
- **Age Effect**: Renovations on **newer or mid-aged homes** generate stronger returns, while older properties may not recoup renovation costs.  

</details>

<details>
<summary>üìä Price Segmentation</summary>

- Most homes cluster in the **mid-market (<$1M)**, with luxury properties driving distribution skewness.  
- Renovations and premium features are more valued in high-demand markets but provide limited returns in lower-value areas.  

</details>


‚úÖ **Key Takeaway**: Housing prices are primarily driven by **living space, location, and selective renovations**, with geographic and market nuances significantly shaping ROI. Stakeholders should adopt location-specific strategies ‚Äî focusing on premium upgrades in affluent markets while prioritizing affordability in mid- and lower-tier segments.

## üìä Visualization 
### Average House Price by City
<img width="1589" height="1234" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/986c2bb0-6dc4-47ba-b56f-f99d14147493" />

- **Top-End Markets**: Medina, Clyde Hill, and Mercer Island lead with average prices well above $1M‚Äì$1.7M, reflecting luxury, exclusivity, and proximity to economic hubs.
- **Mid-Market Cluster**: Most cities fall in the $500K‚Äì$700K range, forming the county‚Äôs core residential market.
- **Affordable Markets**: Algona, Pacific, and Skykomish are the most affordable, averaging below $300K, highlighting entry-level opportunities.
- **Geographic Inequality**: Significant spread between the most expensive and cheapest cities (>5√ó difference), underscoring sharp location-driven segmentation.


### Distribution of Housing Prices per Square Foot (Living Area)
<img width="1315" height="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb24d394-901d-4563-837b-749cf938a6f4" />

- **Right-Skewed Price Distribution**: House prices predominantly cluster in the $200‚Äì$300 per sqft range, with most homes valued under $600,000.
- **Median vs. Mean**: Median price ($243 per sqft) is slightly below the mean ($256 per sqft), reflecting skewness driven by a small luxury segment.
- **Luxury Outliers**: High-end properties ($400+ per sqft, $1M+) create a long right tail, increasing variance.
- **Outlier Removal**: Prices below $109 and above $500 per sqft were excluded using the Modified Z-score method to focus on the core market.


### Correlation Heatmap Analysis
<img width="1398" height="1270" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3c18e0d-822a-4491-b961-5f645cb7fb4a" />

- **Living Area**: Strongest predictor of price (0.74 correlation) ‚Üí larger homes drive higher values.
- **Bathrooms & Bedrooms**: Both positively correlated with price (0.57 and 0.38 respectively), with bathrooms showing stronger influence.
- **View**: Moderate correlation with price (0.37) ‚Üí scenic properties add measurable value.
- **Waterfront**: Positive but weaker correlation (0.15) ‚Üí premium exists, but relatively rare in dataset.
- **Condition**: Very weak correlation with price (~0.05) ‚Üí likely due to subjective ratings and the fact that buyers prioritize location and size. In premium markets (e.g., Mercer Island), even homes in average condition still command high prices.

### Renovation Premiums by City

<img width="1390" height="745" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac073199-9847-4feb-bd7c-e2ef9c438165" />

- **Positive ROI**: Renovations add **+10‚Äì13% premium** in more affluent areas (e.g., Normandy Park, Maple Valley, Mercer Island).  
- **Negative ROI**: Markets like **SeaTac, Tukwila, Kirkland** penalize renovations with **‚Äì20% to ‚Äì28% discounts**.  
- **Statistical Significance**:  
  - **Blue dots** = significant impact (consistent effect).  
  - **Gray dots** = no clear measurable effect.  
- **Geographic Divergence**: Renovation ROI varies sharply by location ‚Äî profitable in affluent markets where buyers value upgrades, but often negative in lower-value or saturated areas, where affordability outweighs improvements.

### Impact of House Age on Renovation Premium

<img width="1189" height="832" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cec5f83-221d-4c83-a4ab-ba44117f961f" />

- **Negative Trend**: Renovation premium decreases as the age gap increases ‚Äî older renovated homes capture less value uplift.
- **Younger Renovations Pay Off**: When renovated homes are similar in age (or newer) compared to non-renovated ones, premiums are slightly positive.
- **Older Renovations Penalized**: Large positive age differences (older renovated homes) often result in negative premiums, suggesting buyers discount them.
- **High Variability**: Considerable spread across cities indicates renovation ROI is not consistent and depends on local market dynamics.

### Predictive Accuracy
<img width="1189" height="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc25ff51-95a3-4e0e-96ab-4cf9fc169e37" />

- **Model Validation**: The predicted price of $494,983 aligns well with the actual market distribution for comparable homes, confirming model reliability
- **Market Concentration**: Most actual sales cluster between $450K-$550K, indicating the prediction falls within the high-probability price range
- **Reasonable Variance**: The spread shows typical market variability of ¬±$50K around the predicted value, which is expected for real estate pricing
- **Segment Accuracy**: The model performs well for mid-range Seattle properties (3BR, 2BA, ~1500 sqft), suggesting strong predictive power for this market segment
- **Confidence Benchmark**: The prediction sits near the distribution peak, indicating high confidence in this valuation estimate
