## üìò Project Background & Overview

Modern hiring for data and analytics roles is driven by demonstrable proficiency across a stack of practical skills‚Äîtypically **Python**, **SQL**, **Machine Learning**, **Tableau**, and **Excel**. Training programs and universities increasingly assess students on these skills, yet it‚Äôs often unclear *which skills most influence placement outcomes (e.g., getting placed vs. not placed)

This project analyzes a cohort of students with recorded scores in the five core skills above and their corresponding placement outcomes. My aim is to *quantify the relationship* between skill proficiency and placement to identify *which skill areas carry the most predictive power*

### Objectives
- **Explain** how each skill (individually and in combination) relates to student placement.
- **Prioritize** the skills that matter most using interpretable importance metrics.
- **Identify thresholds** and ‚Äúminimum viable profiles‚Äù (balanced skill mixes that consistently correlate with successful placement).
- **Guide interventions** for students and instructors (where to focus practice time to maximize placement probability).

### Stakeholders & Use Cases
- **Students:** Understand which skills to improve first to cross critical placement thresholds.
- **Instructors / Program Leads:** Calibrate curriculum emphasis and assessment rubrics to align with hiring signals.
- **Placement Cells / Career Services:** Target workshops and mock interviews for skills that yield the highest uplift.

### Assumptions & Limitations
- The analysis is **observational**, not causal; results should be interpreted as **associations** rather than proofs of cause and effect.
- Placement outcomes can be influenced by additional factors (projects, internships, interview performance, networking) that may not be fully captured in the dataset.
- Thresholds and importance may shift across cohorts, markets, and time; periodic refresh is recommended.

- Minimal Linear Relationships: All correlation coefficients range from -0.08 to +0.08, indicating virtually no linear dependency between skills ‚Üí Proficiency in one technical skill (Python, SQL, ML, Tableau, Excel) does not predict proficiency in others
- No Skill Synergy: The dataset shows no evidence of complementary skill relationships or natural skill groupings since  there is no strong correlations exist ‚Üí can‚Äôt assume that someone who knows Python will also know SQL, ML, Tableau, or Excel.
- No multiple masteries of skills: Independence of skills means that students who mastered multiple skills (e.g., Python + SQL + Tableau) may stand out more strongly

- Training or upskilling opportunities are relevant for all levels of learners ‚Äî since student's score are not concentrated in only beginners or experts.
- This suggests that individuals vary widely in proficiency, and no single skill is heavily concentrated at high or low levels.
- All skewness values are close to zero, indicating symmetry in the distributions.

- The chart shows a moderately successful placement outcome: a majority placed (58%), but a notable 42% non-placement rate highlights an area of concern ‚Äî nearly half of the students could not secure positions ‚Üí Suggests a need for further support in areas such as skill development, interview preparation, or industry alignment.

Python & SQL

- Students who were not placed had slightly higher average Python and SQL scores compared to placed students ‚Üí Suggests that technical proficiency in these two skills alone does not guarantee placement.

ML, Tableau, and Excel

- Students who were placed had higher average scores in ML, Tableau, and Excel compared to non-placed students ‚ÜíIndicates that broader skill sets (especially in applied analytics and business tools) are more aligned with placement outcomes.

Most significant difference

- The largest gap is observed in Machine Learning (ML), where placed students scored notably higher than non-placed ones ‚ÜíThis suggests that advanced, in-demand skills like ML may strongly influence placement success.
