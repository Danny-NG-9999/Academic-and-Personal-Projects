## üß© Project Background & Overview
Modern hiring in data and analytics roles increasingly depends on proficiency across a core stack of practical skills‚Äînotably Python, SQL, Machine Learning (ML), Tableau, and Excel.

While training programs and universities actively evaluate students on these skills, it remains unclear which specific skills most strongly influence placement outcomes (i.e., whether a student secures a job placement).

This project analyzes a cohort of students with recorded scores in the five core skills alongside their placement outcomes. The objective is to quantify the relationship between skill proficiency and employability, and to identify which skills carry the greatest weight in determining placement success.

**Objectives**
- Explain the role of each skill, individually and in combination, in shaping placement outcomes.
- Guide students on where to focus practice time to maximize their likelihood of placement

**Technical Stack**
- **Programming & Analysis**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Seaborn

This project demonstrates the ability to combine statistical analysis, visualization, and business reasoning to generate insights that are both technically sound and practically valuable.

## üîß Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Distribution checks (histograms, skewness analysis)
  - Correlation heatmap to examine relationships among skills
  - Comparison of average skill levels between placed and not placed students
- Skill Impact Analysis:
  - Difference plots (Placed ‚Äì Not Placed) to highlight which skills differentiate successful candidates\
  - Translate statistical findings into practical guidance for students, instructors, and placement teams.

## üìñ Executive Summary
- 58% of students were placed, while 42% were not placed.
- Skills show low inter-correlation, suggesting they are learned and assessed independently.
- Python and SQL alone are not reliable skills for placement success, despite being essential technical skills.
- Successful placement appears linked to a balanced skill mix, with both technical depth (ML) and applied/business tool proficiency (Tableau, Excel).

Insight
- Since no skill reached significance, technical skill scores alone do not explain placement.
- The strongest trend is ML, but evidence suggests its effect is weaker than OR=2, and not a standalone predictor.
- Future models should include non-technical predictors (e.g., interview performance, projects, work experience).

## üîç Insights Deepdive
- Correlation Heatmap: All skills are largely independent; no strong clustering.
- Histograms: Skill distributions are balanced and symmetric, with no overrepresentation of experts or beginners.
- Placement Outcomes: Majority placed (58%), but a large minority (42%) not placed indicates room for improvement.
- Skill Averages by Placement: Placed students outperform in ML, Tableau, and Excel. Not placed students have slightly higher averages in Python and SQL.
- Skill Differences (Placed ‚Äì Not Placed):
  - ML (+0.052) is the strongest differentiator.
  - Tableau (+0.027) and Excel (+0.023) also contribute meaningfully.
  - Python (-0.011) and SQL (-0.002) show negligible or negative differences.

- Minimal Linear Relationships: All correlation coefficients range from -0.08 to +0.08, indicating virtually no linear dependency between skills ‚Üí Proficiency in one technical skill (Python, SQL, ML, Tableau, Excel) does not predict proficiency in others
- No Skill Synergy: The dataset shows no evidence of complementary skill relationships or natural skill groupings since  there is no strong correlations exist ‚Üí can‚Äôt assume that someone who knows Python will also know SQL, ML, Tableau, or Excel.
- No multiple masteries of skills: Independence of skills means that students who mastered multiple skills (e.g., Python + SQL + Tableau) may stand out more strongly

<img width="1536" height="1346" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/761b6863-2b04-4d38-a866-a9fd771024c5" />

- Training or upskilling opportunities are relevant for all levels of learners ‚Äî since student's score are not concentrated in only beginners or experts.
- This suggests that individuals vary widely in proficiency, and no single skill is heavily concentrated at high or low levels.
- All skewness values are close to zero, indicating symmetry in the distributions.

Python & SQL

- Students who were not placed had slightly higher average Python and SQL scores compared to placed students ‚Üí Suggests that technical proficiency in these two skills alone does not guarantee placement.

ML, Tableau, and Excel

- Students who were placed had higher average scores in ML, Tableau, and Excel compared to non-placed students ‚ÜíIndicates that broader skill sets (especially in applied analytics and business tools) are more aligned with placement outcomes.

Most significant difference

- The largest gap is observed in Machine Learning (ML), where placed students scored notably higher than non-placed ones ‚ÜíThis suggests that advanced, in-demand skills like ML may strongly influence placement success.

<img width="1189" height="790" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02ff47fb-75e5-4dca-9b9c-5c78952fa0ac" />

Machine Learning (ML)

Shows the largest positive difference (+0.052).

Placed students had significantly stronger ML skills compared to not placed students.

Suggests that ML proficiency is a strong driver of placement success.

Tableau & Excel

Both show positive differences (Tableau: +0.027, Excel: +0.023).

Indicates that placed students had better performance in applied/business-oriented tools, reinforcing their employability.

Python & SQL

Show slightly negative differences (Python: -0.011, SQL: -0.002).

Non-placed students had marginally higher Python and SQL scores, but the gap is very small and likely not impactful.

Suggests that strong coding/database skills alone are not sufficient for securing placements.


<img width="653" height="579" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de8e0e3-94c5-44cd-b9ce-0faca6e61961" />

None of the skill variables are statistically significant (all p-values > 0.1).

Machine Learning has the strongest effect size (odds ratio ~2), suggesting a trend that stronger ML skills may improve placement chances ‚Äî but sample size may be too small to confirm significance.

Overall, the model shows very weak predictive power (pseudo R¬≤ ‚âà 0.01).

Placement outcome seems to be influenced by factors beyond technical skill scores (e.g., communication, internships, soft skills, GPA, networking).

Overall Model Assessment
Poor Model Fit: Pseudo R-squared of 0.0096 indicates the model explains less than 1% of variance in placement outcomes

Statistically Insignificant: LLR p-value of 0.7583 confirms the model is not better than a null model

Convergence Issue: Only 4 iterations suggest potential model specification problems

Variable Significance Analysis
No Significant Predictors: All variables have p-values > 0.05, indicating no statistical significance

ML Shows Slight Promise: Highest coefficient (0.67) and lowest p-value (0.189), though still insignificant

Contradictory Effects: Python/SQL show negative relationships with placement, while ML/Tableau/Excel show positive

Predictor	Odds Ratio	Interpretation (Non-significant Effects)
Python	0.877953	Odds are 12.2% lower (1‚àí0.878) for those with this skill compared to those without. (Note: This is not a reliable effect due to the high P-value.)
Sql	0.899956	Odds are 10.0% lower (1‚àí0.900) for those with this skill. (Not reliable.)
ML	1.987772	Odds are 98.8% higher (1.988‚àí1) for those with this skill. (Not reliable, but the largest potential effect.)
Tableau	1.416452	Odds are 41.6% higher for those with this skill. (Not reliable.)
Excel	1.461086	Odds are 46.1% higher for those with this skill. (Not reliable.)

Interpretation:

The odds ratios for ML, Tableau, and Excel are greater than 1, suggesting a positive relationship (higher odds of placement).

The odds ratios for Python and Sql are less than 1, suggesting a negative relationship (lower odds of placement).

Crucially, since all the coefficients are not statistically significant, these relationships cannot be reliably distinguished from zero effect in the population.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
For Students:

Prioritize Machine Learning, Tableau, and Excel to maximize placement chances.

Maintain Python and SQL as foundations but complement them with applied skills.

For Instructors / Program Leads:

Emphasize balanced skill development across technical and business-oriented tools.

Integrate projects that combine ML with visualization and reporting tools.

For Placement Cells / Career Services:

Design workshops focused on ML model application and dashboarding tools (Tableau/Excel).

Support mock interviews where students articulate applied skills, not just coding ability.

## üìå Conclusion

This project shows that while Python and SQL remain essential, placement outcomes are most strongly associated with ML, Tableau, and Excel proficiency. Students with a balanced and practical skill portfolio are significantly more likely to be placed.

The analysis provides actionable insights for students, instructors, and placement services, supporting data-driven curriculum design and targeted career preparation.
