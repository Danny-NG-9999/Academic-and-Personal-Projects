# ✈️ Airport Activity and Regional Productivity in the United Kingdom  
### An Empirical Study of Connectivity, Freight Operations, and Economic Growth (1998–2023)

## 📄 Project Overview
This research project — “Airport Activity and Regional Productivity in the United Kingdom” — investigates the economic significance of airport infrastructure as a determinant of regional productivity, bridging a critical evidence gap in UK transportation economics.
While the aviation sector’s global role in promoting connectivity and growth is widely documented, empirical UK-specific evidence remains scarce, particularly at the regional (ITL1) level. This project provides a data-driven, econometrically rigorous evaluation of how variations in airport activity — measured through passenger throughput, freight movement, and aircraft operations — influence and are influenced by regional productivity (GVA per head) over a 25-year period (1998–2023).
